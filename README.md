# Beta testing!

Will be released to public soon. Currently testing for game breaking issues.

PeachesCastle runs on LethalExpansion, which is currently incompatible with LethalLevelLoader moons. I am attempting to remake the moon using LLL so it will work with my modpack, as my crew misses chaos at Castle Grounds. 

I will soon upload the moon to GitHub for issue tracking.

## Known issues:

- No water

- Gravity is broken for objects

- Weird texture issues. Some have black backgrounds rather than transparency

- Proper price point not yet implemented. When scrap amount and difficulty changes, the travel price will increase

- Outdoor enemies/creatures can't move

- Weather weighting incorrect
